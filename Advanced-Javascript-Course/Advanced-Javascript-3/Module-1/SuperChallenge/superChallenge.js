class Character {
  /* Base Character Class
    Your task is to design and implement a Character class with properties 'name' (a string), 'health' (a number), and isAlive (a boolean).
    This class will serve as a foundation for a simple game or simulation where characters can take damage and possibly "die" if their health reaches zero.

    Class Structure:
    Your class should have:
    - a name property that is set through the constructor.
    - a private health property initialized to 100.
    - a static property count to track how many characters have been created.

    Static Methods to add:
    - incrementCount() to increase the count each time a new character is instantiated.
    - getCount() to return the current number of characters.

    Health Management:
    - Include a getter and a setter for health. The setter should ensure that the health value does not fall below zero.

    Damage Functionality:
    - Implement a method 'takeDamage' which decreases the health value by a specified amount.

    Alive Status:
    - Implement a getter for 'isAlive' that returns a boolean value. A character is considered alive if their health is greater than zero.

    Status Report:
    - Implement a method getStatus() that returns a string stating the character's name,
      current health, and whether they are alive or dead.

  get health() {

  }

  set health(newHealth) {
    this.#health = Math.max(0, newHealth);
  }

  takeDamage(decreasedHealthAmount) {
    this.health -= decreasedHealthAmount;
  }

  get isAlive() {
    return this.health > 0;
  }

  getStatus() {
    return `${this.name} has ${this.health} health and is ${
      this.isAlive ? 'alive' : 'dead'
    }.`;

class Hero extends Character {
  /* The Hero class
    The Hero class should inherit from Character. This new class should include additional functionality to manage an inventory of items that the hero can collect during gameplay.

    Constructor:
    - The constructor for the Hero class should initialize the hero with a name and an empty inventory for items.

    Inventory Management:
    - Implement a method pickUpItem that allows the hero to add items to their inventory.
    - Items should simply be added to an array.

    Item Retrieval:
    - Implement a method getItems that returns a string listing all the items in the hero's inventory.

    - The getThreat method should simply return the threat.

// Example Usage
const merlin = new Hero('Merlin');
const medea = new Hero('Medea');
const troll = new Villain('Troll', 'I will destroy your soul!');

console.log(medea.getItems()); // Medea has the following items: Shield
troll.takeDamage(101);
console.log(troll.getStatus()); //Troll has 0 health and is dead.
console.log(medea.getStatus()); // Medea has 95 health and is alive.`
console.log(merlin.getStatus()); // Merlin has 85 health and is alive.
