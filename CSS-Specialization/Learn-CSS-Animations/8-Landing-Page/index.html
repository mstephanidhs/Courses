  <!-- Animation Challenge
-------------------

Your task is to create two animations that will first cause the background to fade in and expand in width from left to right, then fade in the text in the center. The first animation should take 1.5 seconds, followed by a 0.5 second delay, and finally, 1 second for the text fade-in. Both animations should have an ease-out timing function and run once. All styles should be retained once the animation ends. Good luck! -->
